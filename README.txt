MediaWiki is hell to mod.
Let's see if I can make it worse.

v1.0 - Simplify block log strings, add tools to revision history pages, add tools to :Log/block, bunch of other stuff.
v0.4 - Organise user tools into separate column.
v0.3 - Added Nuke link to sidebar.
v0.2 - Moved previous block settings to new "block for spam" link, added preloaded Nuke button.
v0.1 - Basic functionality, preloads "block" button with indefinite (infinite) expiry, reason "Spamming", hard- & autoblocks. Works in Tampermonkey & Chrome.
